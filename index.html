                        <p class="text-justify">Not suitable/safe for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand. Typically, the NSFW tag is used in email, videos, and on interactive discussion areas to mark URLs or hyperlinks which contain material such as pornography, violence
                            or any other type of content which the viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a formal setting such as at work. Determining a site to be NSFW is invariably subjective, and poses challenges for academics. The difficulty
                            in identifying such content objectively has led to the creation of online and offline tools to help individuals to identify NSFW content. This tools have a particular relevance for individuals making personal use of the Internet
                            at workplaces or schools which have policies prohibiting access to sexually provocative and violent content. Companies and schools frequently adopt such policies because they regard the presence of sexual content as a misuse
                            of company property and, potentially, a violation of sexual harassment policy. When developing this type of tools developers tend to rely on machine learning algorithms. To be able to create a good machine learning model developers
                            need a comprehensive data set for training. This would represent a data set that includes booth sexual and violent content. In this project we are proposing creation of a database (DB) and a web service which would allow developers
                            to get a unified dataset for training their machine learning algorithms. This type of dataset is does not exist or is not publicly available. Dataset for pornographic content are available but not one that combines pornographic,
                            violent and other type of NSFW content. Access to this service would allow for development of more innovative solutions for this type of problems. <br></p>
